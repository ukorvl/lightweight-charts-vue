## Code Style

We follow a consistent code style to maintain readability and quality. Please ensure your code adheres to the following guidelines:

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. The project is configured with ESLint, so you can run it locally to check your code.
- Use [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to ensure your commit messages follow the conventional commit style.

## Release Process

When you are ready to release a new version of the library, please follow these steps:

1. Update package version in `lib` directory.
2. Ensure all tests pass and the code is linted.
3. Create a new release branch from `main`.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/vX.X.X
   ```
4. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes made in this release.
5. Commit the changes and push the release branch.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "chore(release): vX.X.X"
   git push origin release/vX.X.X
   ```
6. Create a tag for the release.
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Release vX.X.X"
   git push origin vX.X.X
   ```
7. Create a pull request to merge the release branch into `main`. Prefer rebasing the branch to preserve tag and clear history.
8. Once the pull request is approved, merge it into `main`.
9. Run `Release` workflow in GitHub Actions to publish the new version to npm. Use your tag name as a workflow input.
